A minimal implementation of the card game [Pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)), written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This project is made as a way to become more familiar with the Rust programming language and should not be taken as optimal nor production-ready in any means.
